An [AzerothCore](https://www.azerothcore.org/) module that implements fully functional item
redemption<br> for five World of Warcraft promotional item NPCs present in the 3.3.5a client,
plus an optional boss drop system that generates unique TCG promotional codes on configurable
boss kills and delivers them to players as readable in-game stationery.

| NPC | Location | Items |
|-----|----------|-------|
| **Landro Longshot** | Booty Bay | TCG card set rewards |
| **Ransin Donner** | Ironforge — The Forlorn Cavern | Blizzcon promotional items |
| **Zas'Tysh** | Orgrimmar — Valley of Heroes | Blizzcon promotional items |
| **Garel Redrock** | Ironforge — The Forlorn Cavern | Murloc companions & additional promotional items |
| **Tharl Stonebleeder** | Orgrimmar — Valley of Heroes | Murloc companions & additional promotional items |

Landro Longshot, Ransin Donner, and Zas'Tysh exist in the default AzerothCore database as
stubs with no item delivery logic. Garel Redrock and Tharl Stonebleeder are their counterpart
NPCs — Tharl is present in the 3.3.5a client data, while Garel is a custom spawn that
completes the Alliance side. This module brings all five NPCs to life with configurable
redemption modes, correct item entry IDs, a full GM delivery and management toolset, as well as an
automated boss drop system.

> **Note:** Developed against the
> [mod-playerbots fork](https://github.com/liyunfan1223/azerothcore-wotlk) of AzerothCore.
> Should be compatible with standard AzerothCore mainline. See
> [Compatibility](#compatibility) for details.

## Features

- **Four configurable operation modes** covering every server style, from fully free to
  retail-authentic code redemption.
- **74 reward items** spanning all 13 TCG expansion sets, three Blizzcon promotional items,
  and the full Garel/Tharl promotional catalogue.
- **Multi-item set support** — Spectral Tiger and X-51 Nether-Rocket each award both mount
  variants in a single redemption.
- **Faction-aware delivery** — the Scourgewar Mini-Mount awards the Horde or Alliance variant
  automatically based on the receiving character's race.
- **Unique vs. consumable item classification** — permanent unlocks are one-time per
  character; charged or stackable toys are unlimited.
- **Companion-gated items** — Red War Fuel and Blue War Fuel are freely redeemable in any
  mode, any number of times, but only to characters who have already learned the Warbot
  companion (spell 65682).
- **Inventory fallback** — if a player's bags are full at redemption, all items are mailed
  to the character rather than being blocked or lost.
- **GM free-browse menu** in all modes (including Disabled), allowing Game Masters with GM
  mode active to browse the full catalogue and deliver any item to any character by name.
- **GM force-delivery override** — if a target character has already received a unique item,
  the GM is presented with an override confirmation dialog rather than a silent block.
- **GM redemption flag management** — a dedicated menu option clears all
  `character_tcg_redeemed` records for a named character, resetting their unique-item
  eligibility.
- **Configurable Landro's Box behaviour** — Landro's Gift Box and Landro's Pet Box can be
  set to one-time or unlimited per character independently of all other items.
- **Crash-safe code redemption** — codes are marked used before item delivery so a partial
  delivery on server crash cannot be replayed.
- **Boss drop system** — generates a unique TCG promotional code on each configured boss
  kill and delivers it to players as a readable stationery item, with three configurable
  delivery modes (loot window only, mail only, or both).
- **Interactive code generator dashboard** (`tools/generate_codes.py`) with a terminal UI
  and full non-interactive CLI support for scripted workflows.

## Operation Modes

Set via `TCGVendors.Mode` in `mod-tcg-vendors.conf`.

| Mode | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `0` | **Disabled** | Module registers but defers entirely to default database gossip. No items are offered by the scripts. Useful for temporarily suspending the system without reverting any SQL. |
| `1` | **Free** | No codes required. All players browse the full catalogue and claim items directly from the gossip menu. Unique items are one-time per character; consumables are unlimited. |
| `2` | **Blizz-like** *(default)* | Players enter a pre-generated `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` code at the NPC root dialog. Each code is single-use, tracked at account level. The reward is determined entirely by the code — the player does not browse to an item first. Blizzcon vendors show items directly with per-item code dialogs in this mode. |
| `3` | **Item-Specific Code** | Players browse to a specific item and enter a code for that item. A valid code for a *different* item produces a mismatch error. Closest to the original retail experience. |

> **Note on companion-gated items (War Fuel):** Red War Fuel and Blue War Fuel bypass the
> mode setting entirely. They are always presented as a free confirmation click — no code is
> ever generated or required. The only gate is whether the character has already learned the
> Warbot companion pet.

## Requirements

- [AzerothCore](https://www.azerothcore.org/) 3.3.5a (or the
  [mod-playerbots fork](https://github.com/liyunfan1223/azerothcore-wotlk))
- Python 3.8+ *(for `tools/generate_codes.py` only — server compilation does not require Python)*

---

## Installation

### 1. Place the module

Clone or copy the `mod-tcg-vendors` folder into your AzerothCore `modules` directory:

```
azerothcore-wotlk/
└── modules/
    └── mod-tcg-vendors/     ← folder must be named exactly this
        ├── conf/
        ├── sql/
        ├── src/
        └── tools/
```

> **Important:** If you downloaded a ZIP from GitHub, remove any `-main`, `-master`, or
> similar suffix from the folder name. The folder must be named exactly `mod-tcg-vendors` or
> the build system will generate a mismatched script registration function name and fail to link.

### 2. Apply the SQL

**Characters database** — creates the two tables this module uses:

```bash
mysql -u root -p acore_characters < sql/characters/base/create_tcg_redeemed_table.sql
mysql -u root -p acore_characters < sql/characters/base/create_tcg_codes_table.sql
```

**World database** — sets `ScriptName` on the five NPC entries, adds NPC greeting texts,
ensures the gossip flag is set on each NPC, and handles all creature spawns:

```bash
mysql -u root -p acore_world < sql/world/base/zzz_tcg_vendors_setup.sql
```

The world SQL handles the following automatically — no manual in-game steps required:
- Spawns **Garel Redrock** in The Forlorn Cavern next to Ransin Donner
- Spawns a **Gurky** companion murloc next to Garel, mirroring Tharl and Gurky in Orgrimmar
- Repositions **Murky** in Ironforge to stand next to Ransin Donner in the correct orientation

The SQL does not modify any item templates or other existing world data beyond these NPC rows.

> **Load order:** The file is prefixed `zzz_` so that the DB auto-updater applies it after
> all other module SQL patches, preventing other modules from inadvertently overwriting these
> creature or NPC text entries.

> **Database names:** The commands above use the standard AzerothCore database names
> (`acore_characters`, `acore_world`). Substitute your own database names if they differ.

### 3. Recompile

Reconfigure CMake and rebuild the core. The module is detected and compiled automatically.
Verify it appears in the CMake output:

```
* Modules configuration
  ...
  + mod-tcg-vendors
```

### 4. Configure

Copy `conf/mod-tcg-vendors.conf.dist` to your server's modules conf directory and rename it
by removing the `.dist` extension. Edit the file and set your preferred mode and options. See
[Configuration](#configuration) for all available options.

### 5. Populate redemption codes (Modes 2 and 3 only)

If you are running Mode 2 or Mode 3, generate codes using the included tool and import them
into your characters database before players begin redeeming:

```bash
# Launch the interactive dashboard (recommended for first-time setup)
python3 tools/generate_codes.py

# Or generate a full batch non-interactively
python3 tools/generate_codes.py --all --count 10 --output codes.sql
mysql -u root -p acore_characters < codes.sql
```

See [Code Generator](#code-generator) for full usage.

---

## Configuration

All options live in `mod-tcg-vendors.conf`.

### `TCGVendors.Mode`

Controls the overall behaviour of all five NPCs.

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `0` | **Disabled** — NPCs revert to default database gossip. No items offered. |
| `1` | **Free** — No codes. All players browse and claim items directly. |
| `2` | **Blizz-like** *(default)* — Single root code-entry dialog at Landro Longshot and the promo vendors. Blizzcon vendors list items directly with per-item code dialogs. Codes are single-use, tracked at account level. |
| `3` | **Item-Specific Code** — Browse first, then enter a code for the selected item. |

### `TCGVendors.LandroBoxesMultiRedeem`

Controls whether Landro's Gift Box (54218) and Landro's Pet Box (50301) can be redeemed more
than once per character.

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `0` *(default)* | One-time per character. Both boxes are recorded in `character_tcg_redeemed`. |
| `1` | Unlimited. Both boxes are treated as consumables. In Mode 2/3 each code is still single-use; this only removes the per-character uniqueness gate. |

### `TCGVendors.BossDrop.Enabled`

Master switch for the boss drop system. Default: `0` (disabled).

### `TCGVendors.BossDrop.CreatureIds`

Comma-separated list of creature_template entry IDs for bosses that should trigger a code
drop on kill. Example: `TCGVendors.BossDrop.CreatureIds = 11502,15990,36597`

On every server startup, ALL item 9311 rows are purged from `creature_loot_template` and
then re-inserted exclusively for the entries listed here (subject to
`TCGVendors.BossDrop.MailParticipants` — see below). The loot tables are reloaded
in-process immediately after. Adding or removing a boss takes effect on the next restart.

### `TCGVendors.BossDrop.ItemIds`

Comma-separated list of item entry IDs from the TCG/promotional catalogs. Each boss kill
randomly selects one item from this pool; the generated stationery code will be redeemable
for that item. All entries must exist in the module's reward catalog.
Example: `TCGVendors.BossDrop.ItemIds = 23720,33224,38576`

### `TCGVendors.BossDrop.MailParticipants`

Controls how stationery is delivered to players and whether a loot-window drop is generated.

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `0` *(default)* | **Loot window only.** A single stationery item appears on the boss corpse. Loot template rows for item 9311 are inserted on startup for all configured boss entries. |
| `1` | **Mail only.** Every qualifying group/raid member present on the same map receives a stationery in their mailbox, each with a unique code. No loot template rows are inserted — item 9311 does NOT appear on the corpse. |
| `2` | **Mail AND loot.** Every qualifying participant receives a mailed stationery with their own unique code, AND a single stationery item appears on the boss corpse as a loot-window drop. |

Solo players (no group) receive mail to themselves when mail delivery is active.

---

## Boss Drop System

When enabled, the boss drop system hooks into the kill event for each configured boss. On
kill, a reward item is selected at random from `TCGVendors.BossDrop.ItemIds`, a unique
`XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` code is generated and inserted into `account_tcg_codes` as unredeemed,
and delivery proceeds according to `TCGVendors.BossDrop.MailParticipants`.

The stationery item (Default Stationery, item 9311) is readable in-game by right-clicking it
in the player's inventory. It contains the generated code, the name of the boss defeated,
the name of the redeemable item, and directions to the correct vendor NPC. The code can then
be redeemed at the appropriate NPC using the normal redemption flow.

**Loot table management** is handled automatically on every server startup — no manual SQL
or `.reload creature_loot_template` is ever required. The module purges all item 9311 loot
rows and re-inserts exactly the set dictated by the current config, ensuring the live loot
tables always mirror the config file.

---

## GM Tools

Game Masters with GM mode active (`.gm on`) receive a special menu at all five NPCs in every
operation mode, including Mode 0. GMs playing without GM mode active see the same menu as
regular players.

### Item Delivery

At Landro Longshot, the GM browses through the full expansion tree. At the Blizzcon and
Promo vendors, all items are listed directly. Clicking any item opens a text input prompting
for a character name. The item is then mailed to that character — online or offline — without
consuming a code or checking bag space.

### Force-Delivery Override

If the target character has already received a unique item, the GM is shown an override
confirmation dialog. Typing the character's name a second time confirms the forced
re-delivery, bypassing the redemption flag check entirely.

### Clear Redemption Flags

A dedicated menu option at each NPC prompts for a character name and deletes all rows in
`character_tcg_redeemed` for that character, resetting their eligibility for all unique items.
The count of cleared records is reported back as a whisper.

### Mail an Item Code

This functions exactly like Item Delivery does, except instead of delivering the item to the
player's mailbox, a code and some flavor text are generated into a Default Stationery item,
and mailed to the player so that they can redeem the item themselves in-game.

---

## Code Generator

`tools/generate_codes.py` generates cryptographically random redemption codes in
`XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` format using an unambiguous character set (no `I`, `L`, `O`, `0`, or
`1`). Output is `INSERT IGNORE INTO account_tcg_codes` SQL statements ready to apply directly
to your characters database.

**No external dependencies required.** Uses only the Python standard library.

> **Note:** Red War Fuel, Blue War Fuel, and boss drop codes are intentionally absent from
> the code generator. War Fuel is always redeemed freely at the NPC. Boss drop codes are
> generated automatically at kill time and inserted directly by the server.

### Interactive Dashboard

```bash
python3 tools/generate_codes.py
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Single Item** | Select one item, enter a count and optional output path. |
| **Multi-Select** | `Space` to toggle items, `A` to select all, `N` to clear, `Enter` to confirm. |
| **Full Batch** | Generates codes for all code-redeemable items. Prompts for count and output path. |
| **Quick Batch** | Full batch with a single count prompt — fastest option for populating a new server. |
| **Exit** | Quit. |

### Non-Interactive CLI

```bash
# List all valid reward group keys
python3 tools/generate_codes.py --list-groups

# Generate 10 codes for the Riding Turtle
python3 tools/generate_codes.py --reward-group TCG_RIDING_TURTLE --count 10

# Generate codes for multiple items in one run
python3 tools/generate_codes.py --reward-group TCG_RIDING_TURTLE TCG_SPECTRAL_TIGER --count 5

# Generate codes for every available item and write to a file
python3 tools/generate_codes.py --all --count 10 --output full_batch.sql

# Preview codes without generating SQL
python3 tools/generate_codes.py --reward-group BLIZZCON_MURKY --count 3 --dry-run

# Force the interactive dashboard even if other flags are present
python3 tools/generate_codes.py --interactive
```

### Applying Codes

```bash
mysql -u root -p acore_characters < full_batch.sql
```

---

## Database Tables

### Characters database

**`character_tcg_redeemed`** — tracks which unique items have been delivered to each
character. Prevents a character from receiving the same permanent unlock more than once,
regardless of how many valid codes are presented.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `guid` | `INT UNSIGNED` | Character GUID |
| `item_entry` | `MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED` | Item template entry ID |
| `redeemed_date` | `TIMESTAMP` | When the item was delivered |

Primary key: `(guid, item_entry)`

**`account_tcg_codes`** — stores pre-generated redemption codes. Populated by
`tools/generate_codes.py` for vendor redemptions, and by the boss drop system at kill time.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `code` | `VARCHAR(19)` | The code in `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` format |
| `reward_group` | `VARCHAR(64)` | Identifies which item(s) the code awards |
| `redeemed` | `TINYINT(1)` | `0` = unused, `1` = redeemed |
| `account_id` | `INT UNSIGNED` | Account that redeemed the code (set on use) |
| `character_guid` | `INT UNSIGNED` | Character that received the items (set on use) |
| `redeemed_date` | `TIMESTAMP` | When the code was consumed (set on use) |

Primary key: `code`

The `reward_group` values match the keys shown by `--list-groups` exactly. To add codes
manually without using the generator, insert rows with a valid `reward_group` key and
`redeemed = 0`.

---

## Technical Notes

### Inventory Full — Mail Fallback

If a player's bags are full at the time of redemption, all items for that redemption are
mailed to the character rather than blocking the delivery. The redemption is recorded
immediately so a full-bags situation cannot be exploited to obtain items repeatedly.

### Crash Safety (Modes 2 and 3)

In code-entry modes, the `account_tcg_codes` row is marked as redeemed *before* items are
delivered. In the unlikely event of a server crash between the database update and the item
delivery, a Game Master can verify the code row and use the GM delivery menu to re-deliver
without consuming an additional code.

### Unique vs. Consumable — Companion Items

Several items have `spellcharges = -1` in `item_template`, which might suggest they are
consumable. However, items that teach a **permanent companion spell** are classified as
**Unique** (one-time per character) because the spell is learned once and the player has no
reason to receive the item again. This applies to Soul-Trader Beacon (38050), Banana Charm
(32588), and Tuskarr Kite (49287), among others. True consumables — Papa Hummel's Pet
Biscuit, Path of Illidan, Sandbox Tiger, Paint Bomb, and similar charged toys — are items
where the player genuinely benefits from having more than one.

### Scourgewar Mini-Mount Faction Handling

The Scourgewar Mini-Mount has two item entries: Little Ivory Raptor Whistle (49288) for
Horde and Little White Stallion Bridle (49289) for Alliance. The delivery system resolves
the correct variant from the *receiving character's* race — not the GM's or the redeeming
player's. The redemption key stored in `character_tcg_redeemed` is always 49288 regardless
of which variant was delivered, so the per-character gate works correctly for both factions.

### Boss Drop Stationery Readability

The stationery item uses `ITEM_FIELD_FLAG_READABLE` (flag `0x00000200`) to signal to the
WoW 3.3.5a client that the item has readable text. The text is written directly to
`item_instance.text` immediately after the item is saved, in addition to being set via
`Item::SetText()`, to guarantee the text is available before any client query arrives.

### GM Force-Delivery Encoding

For the GM force-delivery override at Landro Longshot, the `action` value passed to the
confirmation handler encodes both the expansion sub-menu sender and the item index as
`(origSender << 8) | origAction`. This allows the override handler to reconstruct exactly
which item is being re-delivered without any additional state. Safe as long as sender values
and item counts per expansion remain below 256, which they do with considerable headroom.

---

## Compatibility

| Core | Status |
|------|--------|
| [mod-playerbots fork](https://github.com/liyunfan1223/azerothcore-wotlk) | ✅ Developed and tested here |
| [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk) mainline | ✅ Should be compatible |

The script registration function is named `Addmod_tcg_vendorsScripts()`, following the
Playerbots fork build system conventions. This name is also valid on standard AzerothCore
(the convention was standardised in a 2022 core update), so no changes should be required
for either target.

  four categories: Murloc Companions, Classic & Special Promotions, Blizzard Store, and
  Special Events & Tournaments.
- `zzz_tcg_vendors_setup.sql` — automatically spawns Garel Redrock and Gurky in The Forlorn
  Cavern (Ironforge), repositions Murky next to Ransin Donner, prefixed `zzz_` for correct
  DB auto-updater load order.
- All promo items added to `generate_codes.py`; War Fuel explicitly excluded (no codes).
- GM force-delivery override — when a target character has already received a unique item,
  GM is shown a confirmation dialog rather than a silent block. Typing the character's name
  a second time bypasses the redemption flag.

### v1.1 — Boss drop system

- `tcg_boss_drop_world_script` — on startup, purges all item 9311 rows from
  `creature_loot_template` and re-inserts exactly the set dictated by `BossDrop.CreatureIds`
  and `BossDrop.MailParticipants`, then reloads creature loot tables in-process.
- `tcg_boss_drop_script` — `PlayerScript` using `OnPlayerCreatureKill` to detect configured
  boss kills, generate a code, park metadata for the loot hook, and optionally mail unique
  stationery to all group/raid participants.
- `tcg_boss_drop_player_script` — `PlayerScript` using `OnPlayerLootItem` to inject the
  generated code text onto the freshly-created stationery instance when a player loots it
  from the boss corpse.
- `StampItemText()` — sets `ITEM_FIELD_FLAG_READABLE` and `Item::SetText()` to make the
  stationery right-clickable and readable in-game.
- `DirectWriteItemText()` — immediately writes text to `item_instance.text` as a safety net
  for forks where `SaveToDB` does not include `m_text`.
- `TCGVendors.BossDrop.MailParticipants` expanded from bool to three-value int: `0` = loot
  only, `1` = mail only (no loot rows inserted), `2` = mail and loot.
- New config keys: `TCGVendors.BossDrop.Enabled`, `TCGVendors.BossDrop.CreatureIds`,
  `TCGVendors.BossDrop.ItemIds`, `TCGVendors.BossDrop.MailParticipants`.
- `#include "Group.h"` and `#include "LootMgr.h"` added.

### v1.2 — GM Send Item Code

- `BuildGMCodeText`, `HandleGMSendCode`, `ShowExpansionListForCode`,
  `ShowExpansionItemsForCode`, `ShowPromoCategoryListForCode`, and `ShowPromoItemsForCode` 
  added to handle generating the custom text for the Stationery item, and the
  new menu option to allow GM's in GM mode to send an item code to a player.
